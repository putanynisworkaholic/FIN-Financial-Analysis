# 📊 FedEx Financial Analysis (2024 Edition)

### 👤 Project Owner : Putanyn Manee 🇹🇭 🙇🏻‍♂️

Welcome to the **FedEx Financial Analysis Project**! This repository contains an in-depth analysis of FedEx's financial performance from 2019 to 2024. The analysis dives deep into key financial metrics like income, balance sheets, cash flows, ratios, and more. 📈

### 📝 Overview

The aim of this project is to evaluate how FedEx has been performing financially over the past five years. The numbers are crunched to provide insights into their profitability, liquidity, solvency, efficiency, and even potential risk of bankruptcy.

In addition to this, the project includes a comparison of FedEx’s performance with two of its biggest rivals—DHL and UPS—to get a sense of how they stack up in the industry. 🔍

### 📦 Data Source

All the data used in this analysis was imported from **AlphaVantage** (automating things! 🚀). After importing, the data was cleaned up and prepped for analysis in the Jupyter notebook. Curious about how that process happens? Check out `alphavantage.ipynb` where the entire data cleaning process is shown step-by-step. ✨

**Note:** You will need your own AlphaVantage API key to run the data import. Be sure to sign up on AlphaVantage's website to get a free key, and insert it into the `alphavantage.ipynb` file where indicated. 🔑

### 🔧 Project Structure

Here's what’s included in the repository:

- **`alphavantage.ipynb`**: This notebook contains the code for pulling financial data from AlphaVantage and cleaning it for analysis. ⚙️
- **`fdx_financial_analysis.xlsx`**: The cleaned and processed dataset, ready for analysis. 📊
- **`.DS_Store`**: A system file that can be ignored or deleted. 🙃
